        What's up. I'm Macka, a first year visual communications student at UTS. I actually have a computer
        science background, but after a year in that line of work I decided it wasn't for me. I felt a strong
        need to switch to a field with more creative focus and having done graphic design as a hobby for years
        the choice to pursue it was easy.

        This is the very first project completed for my visual communications course. It is an intersection 
        of two interests of mine: typography and paper craft. The brief tasked us with analysing two fonts,
        in my case Gill Sans and Centaur, by generating three outcomes for each representing character, 
        characterisaton and characteristics.
      </p>
      <p className="body-text">
        The project also served as our first formal introduction to anatomies and taxonomies of typefaces. 
        We studied broad categorisations of serifs and sans serifs, but also more subtle classifications 
        such as geometric, grotesque, neo-grotesque and humanist fonts.

        This brief called for the synthesis of imagery and elements of graphic language to create twelve 
        images corresponding to the animals of the Chinese zodiac. All images have been hand cut and 
        physically constructed out of coloured paper and found images from magazines.

        My approach emphasized a distinct graphic style, incorporating abstract geometry and simplified 
        geometrical representations of each animal.

        This assignment called on us to continuously reflect upon our own practice, as
        well as the practice of other designers. The outcomes seen here include a series of insight
        cards, serving to capture and communicate some key learnings from my second semester. 
      </p>

        Also included an outcome from the "Image That Can Change" component of the assignment. This takes
        the form of a graphic rendered through the library p5.js. My graphic is an indication of what is
        liable to happen if you do not manage your time well (metaphorically, of course). Click the image

        This project required us to photographically capture 20 elements of design whilst maintaining
        a sense of visual consistency across the set. The project emphasized both taking and 
        curating photos. At the end of this process I came away with this series tied together by a
        visual theme framing imagery against a vast blue sky.

        This poster is the outcome of an investigation into 3D type. The brief asked for us to embody the 
        essence of the quote and the historical context of the author to whom the quote was attributed to
        through use of handmade elements. In my work I aimed to communicate this through a playfulness for
        which Paul Klee was known, and a colour scheme reminiscent of his work on colour theory.

        The choice of the use of paper craft is a continuation of a developing affinity with the medium

        This assignment introduced us to the possibilities associated with incorporating elements of
        chance into the design process. Using a series of prompts and randomness we generated a concept
        for a world, which served as a basis for both a small zine and virtual experience.
      </p>

        The virtual experience was made on the Mozilla hubs platform. It was an interesting opportunity
